		<h2>The Details </h2>
			<p>You can expect a rooster to crow, a magpie to steal their desires and every bird to go silent as a hawk passes overhead. What you don't expect is a bird who hung itself but
			this is exactly what we found when we stepped into the neighborhood of Meadow Street in Happy Valley. The residents had called us in a fright...</p>
		<h2>The Conclusion </h2>
			<p> To this day we do not know the menace who attacked so any birds in so many ways nor who took the time to individually hang each and every one. Who has the time and who also
			has that type of budget for that much string? Were they trying to tell us something? To warn of something that is soon to come? Or did they just really hate birds? 
			Only time will tell and time is the most telling of them all.</p>
