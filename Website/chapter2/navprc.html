		<h2> The Details </h2>
			<p> It might not suprise you that yet another of our cases starts with someone dead on the ground, left alone to be found later. 
			<br>What makes me write of this case is not that a body was found but rather what they found with it. 
			Harry Bylong was a student at the university of Puget Sound. Pursuing a degree in mmusic, you would have thought that that he would have been
			hard at work in one of the many practice rooms on campus. Instead, he and his friends found themselves closer to the case than they ever would have thought....</p>
		<h2> The Conclusion </h2>
			<p> While no one will truly know what occured when the light hit that house, we know one a few things for certain. The boy we knew as Harry Bylong is not long for
			this world, the girl he found that fateful night was indeed just another innocence lost to the aspects of time, sacrificed at the cruel hands of another man who believes
			himself to be a witch. And the man-witch, who created all this chaos, who murdered Joelene Reed, who poisened poor Harry Bylong, is still at large. 
			<br> Be careflul crime fighters - do not cross his path. </p>
